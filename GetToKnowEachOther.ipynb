    "   - There are some obvious improvements to be done (e.g. modify the hardcoded functions, make the random not be able to reselect the same question, the UI lol).\n",

    "       - questions to get to know each other, separated in 3 levels of depth: ice breaker, deep, deeper\n",
    "       - This is good. Could you give me 20 questions per level\n",
    "       - continue\n",
    "       - write me python code that will do the following when it runs:\n",
    "            - open a window with a message that welcomes you to this game (find me a good name) and says that it is to get to know each other. Write a funny warning message saying that if this is for a date, you might be off to a bad start by opening Python.\n",
    "            - this window should briefly explain to you the 3 levels of depth\n",

    "            - there is a button to go to the next question, also chosen at random.\n",
    "            - After 4 questions at the first level, a second button will also appear saying \"Go deeper\"\n",
    "            - This takes you to the next depth level.\n",
    "            - At this level, after 4 questions, there will be the button to go next, the button to \"go deeper\", and a button to \"go shallower\"\n",
